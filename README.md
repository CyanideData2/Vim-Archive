# Vim-Archive

Hi! I'm Cyanide, a relatively newbie programmer who has started using Vim at the same time as I learned to code. 
Although I am not the fastest or most fluent in Vim, I love the customization that it allows. 
Here I have compiled the different tools that I've created for my Vim setup that I haven't been able to find online.


## Smart Spelling Alternator
Small addition for your vimrc for all you bilingual folks who need to change the language of spelling vim is using, without having to use them both at the same time. With this binding, Ctrl+u should alternate between the two languages (A and B in the code), provided you have the files for both of them installed. This would be the equivalent to WIN+SPACE but exclusively for vim. In case you work with three languages, there's now a second binding to Ctrl+e that adds a third one. It's important to notice that each command toggles between two languages so there's a small tweak to avoid toggling from A (AB button) to A (AC button).
